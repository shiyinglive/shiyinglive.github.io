Thanks to the generous support from AMS, I am fully funded to participate in this wonderful program of [Mathematics Research Commnunities](https://www.ams.org/programs/research-communities/mrc-23), May 28-June 3, 2023. Our group gave a presentation titled  "Gradient flows in the probability simplex" at the conclusion of the workshop.
