The 45th [SIAM-SEAS](https://conference.math.vt.edu/vt-siam-seas/index.html) (SIAM Southeastern Atlantic Section Annual Meeting) will be hosted by Virginia Tech.
I will speak in the mini-symposium "Non-linear stochastic data assimilation - theory and applications". The  __session__ info can be found below.

Description of session: Reconstruction of the probability density functions 
underlying stochastic observational data is a commonly encountered 
problem in fields ranging from biology to material science and image 
processing. Identification of non-linear dependence upon model 
parameters is a particular concern, investigated in this mini-symposium 
through techniques from optimal transport, differential geometry, 
information theory and topology. A common thread for all these 
approaches is identification of a submanifold that forms a minimal 
support for the data. Talks include both theoretical approaches as well 
as case studies using real-world data.
