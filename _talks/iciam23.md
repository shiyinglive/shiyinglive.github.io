I gave a presentation titled ""Efficient subspace modeling via transport transforms" in the mini-symposium [“Theoretical and computational advances in measure transport”](https://iciam2023.org/registered_data?id=00966). 

Together with Wuchen Li, Siting Liu, Caroline Moosmueller, I co-organized the mini-symposium [Mean field games and optimal transport with applications in data science and biology](https://iciam2023.org/registered_data?id=00635).
